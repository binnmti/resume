# Introduction 

As a programmer, I have the skills to create anything I can imagine. However, I have always wondered how to use those skills in the infinite possibilities of the world. For this reason, I would like to talk to people who want to work with me or create something together, whether they are companies or individuals. For example, even in industries where there are no programmers, I believe that I can support system improvements and efficiency by entering the industry, and I am looking for a place where I can contribute regardless of industry. If we are fortunate enough to have a connection, it may lead to full-time employment, or we may be able to support you as a side job or in the form of an advisor. If you are interested, please feel free to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you via the [form](https://forms.gle/cUFBadG8FXLJzPBPA).

# Self-introductionAs 

a programmer, I have been developing games and large-scale systems for about 20 years. My work mainly involves Windows development using C++ and C#, and I am also proactive in proposing and implementing tests and reviews. In addition, I have introduced CI/CD tools between projects and have been involved in holding internal events and study sessions. I have also experienced leadership work. As a side job, I have experience in introducing CI/CD testing, technical interviews and recruitment, and as a school instructor, and I have co-authored a book. In my personal development, I have studied web-based technologies from scratch and consistently created infrastructure, server side, and front end. I have held over 200 hackathons and study sessions over the past 10 years, focusing on C# technology. I have been awarded the Microsoft MVP 12 times for these activities.

# What kind of work do 

I want to do? I love writing programs and making things, so I want to work to realize interesting ideas. I also feel motivated to make the things I make even better, so I would like to work at a company that already has its own services. I am particularly interested in the game industry, web industry, and Web3 industry, and I would also like to work in a support role that leads to work efficiency by adding programmers. I am also very welcome to challenges with new technologies. I don't mind leadership work, but I would like to demonstrate my abilities in a job that actually involves writing code. Full remote work is not required, but I would be happy if I could choose remote work as an option. 

--- 

# When can I start working? 

I have worked for 25 years, and this is the first time I have decided to take a slightly longer break. I don't have enough assets to not have to work, but I decided that it would be good to have such a period in my life. My wife also agreed. One thing I'll do during my vacation is [study](https://github.com/binnmti/Study). Since November, I've been studying computer science, algorithm problems, compiler creation, Buddhism, nutrition, and independent research. The other is to talk to people who are interested in this resume. I plan to do these two things until I'm satisfied with them before I start working. Therefore, although it may change depending on the situation, I'm thinking of starting work next June or later.

## Code 

> I write code regularly as a hobby, and although I don't have a hit service, I am creating something. I try to upload the code I write to [Github](https://github.com/binnmti/) whenever possible. I also try to actively use technologies that are not used in my work. I don't have any work experience with web-related things in particular, but I've reached a level where I can realize anything I can think of in a C# + Azure environment. Recently I've been trying React + Firebase.
